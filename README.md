# hsfetch
Ufetch rewritten in haskell
# Status
W.I.P, Slowly working on this, as progressing through HFFP
Got to know monads, which was all I needed ( albeit, I am like, at the stage of folds in the book but shh )

# Why
Just wanted a somewhat simple project to write after, or while getting done with book
# When
Now. Albeit slowly.
Still might do it again from scratch, but will see.
Also nya. Because Nya.
